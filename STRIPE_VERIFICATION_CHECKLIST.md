## üìã Setup Verification Checklist

Complete these steps to activate your Stripe integration:

### Step 1: Database Preparation
- [ ] Run `npm run db:push` to create payments table
- [ ] Verify database migration completed successfully
- [ ] Test database connection with health check: `GET /api/health`

### Step 2: Stripe Account Configuration
- [ ] **API Keys Retrieved**
  - [ ] Publishable key copied (starts with `pk_`)
  - [ ] Secret key copied (starts with `sk_`)
  - [ ] Keys are for correct environment (test vs live)

- [ ] **Webhook Endpoint Configured**
  - [ ] Webhook URL set to: `https://your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
  - [ ] Events configured: `checkout.session.completed`, `payment_intent.succeeded`

### Step 3: Environment Variables
- [ ] **Required Variables Set**
  - [ ] `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = your secret key
  - [ ] `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = your publishable key  
  - [ ] `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` = your webhook signing secret
  - [ ] `FULL_SCAN_PRICE_AMOUNT` = 4900 (or custom amount in cents)

- [ ] **Variable Verification**
  - [ ] No extra spaces or characters in values
  - [ ] Keys match the intended environment (test/live)
  - [ ] Application restarted after adding variables

### Step 4: Integration Testing
- [ ] **Configuration Test**
  ```bash

  # Should return: "paymentsEnabled": true, "publishableKeyPresent": true
  ```

- [ ] **Frontend Payment Flow**
  - [ ] Visit scan detail page
  - [ ] "Buy Full Scan" button appears and is clickable
  - [ ] Clicking redirects to Stripe Checkout (test mode)
  - [ ] Can complete test payment with card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`

- [ ] **Webhook Verification**
  - [ ] Complete a test payment
  - [ ] Check application logs for webhook receipt
  - [ ] Verify payment status updates in database
  - [ ] Confirm content access is granted

### Step 5: Content Gating Verification
- [ ] **Free User Experience**
  - [ ] Limited scan insights displayed
  - [ ] "Premium content available after purchase" message shown
  - [ ] Payment button visible and functional

- [ ] **Paid User Experience**

## üîß Technical Verification Commands

### Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health
# Should return status: "healthy" with database connectivity
```

### Payment Configuration
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com/api/payments/config
# Expected response when properly configured:
{
  "success": true,
  "paymentsEnabled": true,
  "publishableKeyPresent": true,
  "publicKey": "pk_...",
  "currency": "usd",
  "defaultAmount": 4900
}
```

### Webhook Test (using Stripe CLI)
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5000/api/stripe/webhook
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: `"paymentsEnabled": false`
**Cause:** Missing or incorrect `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
**Solution:** 
1. Verify key is copied correctly from Stripe Dashboard
2. Ensure no extra spaces or characters
3. Restart application after setting variable

### Issue: Webhook signature verification failed
**Cause:** Incorrect `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
**Solution:**
1. Copy exact signing secret from webhook settings
2. Verify webhook URL is precisely `/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Ensure endpoint is publicly accessible

### Issue: Database relation "payments" does not exist
**Cause:** Database migration not completed
**Solution:**
1. Run `npm run db:push`
2. Select "create table" when prompted
3. Verify migration completes successfully

### Issue: Frontend shows loading but no payment button
**Cause:** Missing `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`
**Solution:**
1. Set public key in environment variables
2. Key must be prefixed with `VITE_` for frontend access
3. Restart application

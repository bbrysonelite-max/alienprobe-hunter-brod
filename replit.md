# Overview

This is the "AlienProbe.ai Business Scanner" - a production-ready, full-stack web application that provides business analysis and scanning capabilities. The application allows users to input business information (name and optional website) and generates scan results with insights about the business. It features a modern React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend and comprehensive PostgreSQL integration via Drizzle ORM.

The project includes a complete business scanning workflow with real-time status updates, a results dashboard, sleek space-themed UI design, and enterprise-grade infrastructure including monitoring, logging, database migrations, and health checks. The application offers AlienProbe.ai products including basic scans, pro analysis, and premium subscriptions.

**Production Status**: âœ… Fully deployed and operational as of September 19, 2025

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite for build tooling
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system featuring space/alien theme
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

## Backend Architecture
- **Primary Stack**: Node.js with Express and TypeScript (Production Implementation)
- **Alternative Stack**: Python Flask (Legacy/Reference Implementation)
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON communication
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for type-safe request/response validation
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- **Production Features**: 
  - Structured logging with request correlation IDs
  - Environment configuration validation
  - Automated database migrations
  - Health monitoring endpoints
  - Graceful shutdown handling

## Data Storage Solutions
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL via connection pooling
- **Alternative**: SQLite for Flask implementation
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema generation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with database schema

## Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Basic user management with UUID primary keys
- **Scan Results Table**: Business scan data with status tracking, timestamps, and JSON scan data storage
- **Chat Messages Table**: Conversational AI message storage with conversation linking and context metadata
- **Shared Schema**: Common TypeScript types shared between frontend and backend

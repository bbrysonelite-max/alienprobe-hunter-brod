## ðŸ“‹ Required Setup Steps

### Step 1: Database Schema Migration

First, create the payments table in your database:

```bash
# Run this command in your project root
npm run db:push

# When prompted "Is payments table created or renamed from another table?"
# Select: "+ payments create table"
```

**Alternative:** If the interactive prompt doesn't work, manually select "create table" option.

### Step 2: Stripe Account Configuration

From your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) for Alienprobo.ai:

#### 2.1 Get API Keys
1. Go to **Developers** â†’ **API keys**
2. Copy your **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_`)
3. Copy your **Secret key** (starts with `sk_`)

#### 2.2 Configure Webhooks
1. Go to **Developers** â†’ **Webhooks**
2. Click **Add endpoint**
3. **Endpoint URL:** `https://your-domain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
4. **Listen to:** Select these events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
5. Click **Add endpoint**
6. Copy the **Signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)

### Step 3: Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to your Replit project:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... # or sk_test_... for testing
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_... # or pk_test_... for testing
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Optional: Custom pricing (default is $49.00)
FULL_SCAN_PRICE_AMOUNT=4900  # Amount in cents
```

#### How to Add Environment Variables in Replit:
1. Open your Replit project
2. Click on **Tools** â†’ **Secrets**
3. Add each variable with its value
4. Restart your application workflow

### Step 4: Verification

After setting environment variables, verify the integration:

```bash
# Check payment configuration
curl https://your-domain.com/api/payments/config

# Expected response (with payments enabled):
{
  "success": true,
  "paymentsEnabled": true,
  "publishableKeyPresent": true,
  "publicKey": "pk_live_...",
  "currency": "usd",
  "defaultAmount": 4900
}
```

- Paid users see complete analysis
- Automatic access control based on payment status

## ðŸ§ª Testing Guide

### Test Mode Setup
1. Use test API keys from Stripe Dashboard
2. Use test webhook endpoint for development
3. Test cards: `4242 4242 4242 4242` (Visa)

### Test Scenarios
1. **Successful Payment:**
   - Create scan â†’ Initiate payment â†’ Complete with test card
   - Verify access granted and content unlocked

2. **Failed Payment:**
   - Use declining test card: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
   - Verify graceful error handling

3. **Webhook Testing:**
   - Use Stripe CLI for local webhook testing
   - Verify events are processed correctly

2. Check environment variable format (no extra spaces)
3. Restart application after adding variables

### Webhook Signature Verification Failed
**Issue:** Webhook returning 400 error

**Solutions:**
